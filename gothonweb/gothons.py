The Gothons of Planet Percal #25 have invaded your ship and destroyed your
entire crew.  You are the last surviving member and your last mission is to get
the neutron destruct bomb from the Weapons Armory, put it in the bridge, and
blow the ship up after getting into an escape pod.

You're running down the central corridor to the Weapons Armory when a Gothon
jumps out, red scaly skin, dark grimy teeth, and evil clown costume flowing
around his hate filled body.  He's blocking the door to the Armory and about to
pull a weapon to blast you.

Lucky for you they made you learn Gothon insults in the academy.  You tell the
one Gothon joke you know:

ubhfr.
The Gothon stops, tries not to laugh, then busts out laughing and can't move.
While he's laughing you run up and shoot him square in the head putting him
down, then jump through the Weapon Armory door.

You do a dive roll into the Weapon Armory, crouch and scan the room for more
Gothons that might be hiding.  It's dead quiet, too quiet.  You stand up and run
to the far side of the room and find the neutron bomb in its container.  There's
a keypad lock on the box and you need the code to get the bomb out.  If you get
the code wrong 10 times then the lock closes forever and you can't get the bomb.
The code is 3 digits.

The container clicks open and the seal breaks, letting gas out.  You grab the
neutron bomb and run as fast as you can to the bridge where you must place it in
the right spot.

You burst onto the Bridge with the neutron destruct bomb under your arm and
surprise 5 Gothons who are trying to take control of the ship.  Each of them has
an even uglier clown costume than the last.  They haven't pulled their weapons
out yet, as they see the active bomb under your arm and don't want to set it
off.

You point your blaster at the bomb under your arm and the Gothons put their
hands up and start to sweat.  You inch backward to the door, open it, and then
carefully place the bomb on the floor, pointing your blaster at it.  You then
jump back through the door, punch the close button and blast the lock so the
Gothons can't get out.  Now that the bomb is placed you run to the escape pod to
get off this tin can.

You rush through the ship desperately trying to make it to the escape pod before
the whole ship explodes.  It seems like hardly any Gothons are on the ship, so
your run is clear of interference.  You get to the chamber with the escape pods,
and now need to pick one to take.  Some of them could be damaged but you don't
have time to look.  There's 5 pods, which one do you take?
